<h3><em>Artifical Intelligence working in Construction.</em></h3>
<p><em>When it comes to letting AI go into the construction workplace I feel as though it is a great idea, but for the future. 
  Getting these machines to do all the heavy lifting that is too much for human power is a good idea. However,
   when it comes to making these big decisions and major changes to plans, that responsibility should lie with the construction manager or people with a lot of experience and understanding of the situation at hand.
    These kinds of scenarios cannot be given to a machine to figure out until we know how to do them consistently and safely.
     Machine minds now know how to solve simple problems and are given the right information and provide 100% correct answers most of the time, 
     but they need to produce answers 100% correct 100% of the time before it should be allowed to replace important jobs like this.
      Jordan, M, I (2019) states “Such systems must cope with cloud-edge interactions in making timely, distributed decisions,
      and they must deal with long-tail phenomena where there is lots of data on some individuals and little data on most individuals.” </em></p>

<h3><em>Artificial Intelligence in medical applications.</em></h3>
<em>
<p>Mitigating the risks associated with integrating AI into the medical setting is essential to ensure patient safety and build trust in these technologies. 
  Several strategies can be implemented to address these risks and promote responsible use of AI in healthcare, thus mitigating potential harm in the future.</p>
<p>One key strategy is rigorous testing and validation. AI algorithms should undergo comprehensive evaluation against diverse datasets and benchmarked against established standards. 
  This helps identify potential errors or biases, ensuring that AI systems meet defined safety and accuracy criteria. Enhancing the explain-ability of AI systems is crucial. 
  Techniques should be developed to provide transparent explanations for AI-generated decisions. This allows healthcare professionals to understand and evaluate the reasoning behind recommendations, 
  facilitating the identification of erroneous or biased outputs.</p>
<p>Ethical data curation is essential to mitigate biases in AI systems. Diverse and representative datasets should be used for training, 
  and regular audits and monitoring can help identify and rectify any biases that emerge during AI system development. 
  Governments and regulatory bodies should establish clear guidelines and standards for the development and deployment of AI in healthcare. 
  These frameworks should encompass data privacy, security, transparency, and accountability. Regular audits and certifications can ensure compliance, fostering responsible use of AI technologies.</p>
<p>Collaboration between healthcare professionals, AI developers, ethicists, and regulatory experts is crucial. Engaging diverse stakeholders can help identify and address potential risks, ethical considerations, 
  and legal implications associated with AI in healthcare. Multidisciplinary approaches promote a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and facilitate effective mitigation strategies. 
  Ongoing monitoring and feedback loops are essential. Continuous monitoring of system performance, collecting feedback from healthcare professionals and patients, 
  and addressing identified shortcomings promptly contribute to the safety and effectiveness of AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>Implementing these strategies enables healthcare systems to proactively mitigate risks associated with AI integration. Responsible and transparent use of AI technologies in healthcare fosters trust and confidence among healthcare professionals,
   patients, and society as a whole, paving the way for a future where AI positively contributes to healthcare delivery.</p>
