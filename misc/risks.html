<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

<h3><em>Artifical Intelligence working in Construction.</em></h3>
<p><em>A potential issue that we may encounter would be the AI’s lack of understanding towards the human workers. 
  The AI cannot determine the pace of a contractor's average working speed without studying that individual during a project. 
  Nor will the AI be able to have a strong understanding of the level of tiredness or level of stress that the team by be experiencing. 
  Sinz (2019) seconds this when saying “The lack of robustness to simple changes in the input statistics indicates that deep networks lack human-like scenes of understanding”.
   (vol. 103). Although having a system like this can save companies a lot of money in the long run, the initial startup cost would be substantial compared to hiring an experienced worker. 
   But as previously stated in our introduction to our topic. </em></p>


<p><em>AI working for us in the workforce is a bittersweet idea. Helping to prevent loss of money and major accidents is a huge advantage. 
  However, this will take away jobs away from society, and in a world where people are already struggling to find work, it is not ideal. 
  Another reason why we should not implement ideas like this is because AI has not reached that level of intelligence yet. If we cannot perform a certain task, 
  how are we expected to teach a computer how to do it? This is also shown in writing by Jordan, M. I. (2019). According to Jordan, M. I. 
  (2019) “human intelligence is the only kind of intelligence we know; thus, we should aim to mimic it as a first step. However, 
  humans are in fact not very good at some kinds of reasoning— we have our lapses, biases, and limitations. Moreover, critically, 
  we did not evolve to perform the kinds of large-scale decision-making that modern II systems must face, nor to cope with the kinds of uncertainty that arise in II contexts”. </em></p>
