<h3><em>Artifical Intelligence working in Construction.</em></h3>
<p><em>Construction management roles consist of setting targets and objectives. They are also responsible for supervising staff on a regular basis and making sure health and safety is up to standard.
   Another responsibility that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would thrive on is setting budgets and making sure the company stays within said budget. This is also shown in Rao newspaper about the benefits of AI in construction,
    Rao (2023) states “Most mega projects go over budget despite employing the best project teams. Artificial Neural Networks are used on projects to predict cost overruns based on factors such as project size,
     contract type and the competence level of project managers.” (vol. 38). This means AI would also be very effective in designing and creating blueprints for future buildings.
      This process, if done by AI can save many companies both time and money. The computer would also take into consideration the intended area for the project and things to look out for in that region. For example, 
      AI can help design and create structures that would live through many earthquakes if built in an area with a common occurrence of natural disasters.  
      And machines never stop learning, this can help prevent or fix potential issues in the future that can put a real halt on construction. According to Rao (2023), 
      “Machine learning is like a smart assistant that can scrutinize this mountain of data. It then alerts project managers about the critical things that need their attention.” (vol. 38)</em></p>

<h3><em>Artificial Intelligence in medical applications.</em></h3>
<em>
<p>With the continuously growing global population, hospitals and healthcare providers are facing increasing strain, 
  resulting in overworked doctors and limited resources. (M. M. Kamruzzaman, 2021, I.) says 
  “Revolution in healthcare can be experienced with the advancement of smart sensorial things, 
  Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and edge analytics with the integration of cloud computing; 
  and connected healthcare is receiving extraordinary contemplation from the industry, government, and the healthcare communities. 
  “These technologies in the medical setting hold tremendous potential for relieving the burden on the healthcare system and improving patient care.</p>
<p>AI, when implemented effectively, can function as a personal doctor, revolutionizing healthcare delivery. 
  Through the analysis of vast amounts of medical data, AI algorithms can assist in diagnosing diseases, providing treatment recommendations, 
  and monitoring patient progress. This capability can alleviate the workload on doctors, enabling them to focus on more complex cases, reducing waiting times, 
  and enhancing overall efficiency in healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>Moreover, AI has the power to significantly contribute to medical research. By analysing large datasets and identifying patterns, AI algorithms can aid in the discovery of novel insights, 
  improving our understanding of viruses, diseases, and treatment responses. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, tailored treatment plans, and the development of new therapies.
Machine Learning techniques allow AI systems to learn from data and continuously improve their performance over time. This adaptability and self-improvement capacity make AI an invaluable asset in the medical field. 
  As more patient data is collected and analysed, AI systems can enhance their diagnostic accuracy, treatment recommendations, and predictive capabilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Deep Learning, a subset of ML, has shown remarkable success in various healthcare applications. DL algorithms can analyse complex medical imaging data, such as MRIs or CT scans, to aid in the detection of abnormalities or early signs of diseases. 
  This can facilitate faster and more accurate diagnoses, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.
While the integration of AI, ML, and DL in healthcare brings significant opportunities, it is important to address ethical, privacy, and security concerns associated with these technologies. Ensuring transparency, 
  explain-ability, and robustness of AI systems is crucial to build trust among healthcare professionals and patients.</p>
