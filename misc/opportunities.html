<h3><em>Artifical Intelligence working in Construction.</em></h3>

<p><em>Construction management roles consist of setting targets and objectives. They are also responsible for supervising staff on a regular basis and making sure health and safety is up to standard.
   Another responsibility that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would thrive on is setting budgets and making sure the company stays within said budget. This is also shown in Rao newspaper about the benefits of AI in construction,
    Rao (2023) states “Most mega projects go over budget despite employing the best project teams. Artificial Neural Networks are used on projects to predict cost overruns based on factors such as project size,
     contract type and the competence level of project managers.” (vol. 38). This means AI would also be very effective in designing and creating blueprints for future buildings.
      This process, if done by AI can save many companies both time and money. The computer would also take into consideration the intended area for the project and things to look out for in that region. For example, 
      AI can help design and create structures that would live through many earthquakes if built in an area with a common occurrence of natural disasters.  
      And machines never stop learning, this can help prevent or fix potential issues in the future that can put a real halt on construction. According to Rao (2023), 
      “Machine learning is like a smart assistant that can scrutinize this mountain of data. It then alerts project managers about the critical things that need their attention.” (vol. 38)</em></p>
