<h2>Trust and accountability of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p><em>After the recent development of Chat GPT(Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) it seems as though the world has gone a little crazy over AI(Artifical Intelligence). 
  With this brand-new piece of tech helping millions of people across the globe this has caused a little bit of a reliance on the app, and to think this is still the early stages. However, this got us thinking, 
  if AI ever becomes advanced enough do we let it work? And if so what kind of work can we trust it with? Could we even trust AI in the work force? According to Papenmeier, A. (2022), 
  "Although a general definition for trust in human-machine relationships does not exist, most definitions agree that trust means that the system behaves as the user expects" (p. 35). 
  As if system does not operate how, one excepts and results in an accident of some kind how do we hold accountability to the machine? </p></em>
