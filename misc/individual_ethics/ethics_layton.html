</ul><h4><p>AI in the workforce.<p></h4>



<!-- Main content -->
<h1>Ethics</h1>
<p><em>One of the greatest concerns people have with the evolution of AI is job security. 
	Once a hunk of metal is designed to do your job with no mistakes and by a flick of a switch you would be worried too.
	 Many machines in a business sense can be seen as a one-off purchase to help complete jobs more efficiently than most humans may do.
	  However, in a world where more and more people are finding themselves unemployed it wouldnâ€™t be fair to replace all these people with machines. 
	  We believe that if AI were to be introduced into a workplace, it should be assigned jobs that would be deemed unsafe or harmful for a human to complete.
	   This achieves both keeping everyone their job and dealing with certain tasks that humans may not be able to complete.
